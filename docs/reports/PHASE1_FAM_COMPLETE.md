## 📈 Performance Projections

### Based on Partial Results

**Stage 1 (244 text pages):**
- Estimated: ~3-4 minutes
- Text pages: 244
- Avg per page: ~1 second
- Sections per page: ~6.7

**Stage 2 (1,626 sections):**
- Current rate: ~2.32s per section (from FAM partial test)
- Estimated total: ~62 minutes
- Actual: TBD

**Stage 3 (multi-version):**
- Expected sections: ~5-10
- Time per section: ~8s (2 versions)
- Estimated: ~1-2 minutes

**Total Projected:** ~66-68 minutes (~1.1 hours)

### vs Old Pipeline

**Old Pipeline (FAM):**
- Estimated: 3-4 hours
- All Playwright (slower)
- No batch processing

**New Pipeline (FAM):**
- Estimated: ~1.1 hours
- Hybrid (Firecrawl + Playwright)
- Batch processing

**Improvement:** **3-4x faster** ✅

## 📝 Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring

**Script:** Running in background
**Interval:** Every 3 minutes
**Duration:** Up to 60 minutes
**Metrics:** Sections with content, multi-version count

### Manual Checks

Can check progress anytime with:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "
from pipeline.core.database import DatabaseManager
db = DatabaseManager()
db.connect()
total = db.section_contents.count_documents({'code': 'FAM'})
with_content = db.section_contents.count_documents({'code': 'FAM', 'has_content': True})
print(f'Progress: {with_content}/{total} ({with_content/total*100:.1f}%)')
db.disconnect()
"
```
