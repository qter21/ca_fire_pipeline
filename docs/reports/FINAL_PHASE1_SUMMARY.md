## 🏗️ Architecture Finalized

### Stage 1: Architecture Crawler

**Technology:**
- **Level 1** (Architecture page): Firecrawl
- **Level 2** (Text pages): requests + BeautifulSoup + <h6> parsing

**Process:**
1. Scrape architecture page with Firecrawl (~1-2s)
2. Extract text page URLs from links
3. For each text page:
   - Fetch with requests
   - Parse with BeautifulSoup
   - Extract section numbers from <h6> tags
   - Build section URLs
4. Save to `section_contents` collection

**Performance:**
- EVID (78 text pages): ~8.30s
- FAM (244 text pages): ~TBD (estimated 3-4 min)

### Stage 2: Content Extractor

**Technology:** Firecrawl (batch processing)

**Process:**
1. Get section URLs from MongoDB
2. Batch scrape (50 sections at a time)
3. Parse content with ContentParser
4. Extract legislative history
5. Detect multi-version sections
6. Save with old pipeline fields

**Performance:**
- EVID (88 sections): 131s (1.49s avg)
- FAM (73 sections): 169s (2.32s avg)
- FAM (1,626 sections): ~TBD (estimated 60-80 min)

### Stage 3: Multi-Version Handler

**Technology:** Playwright (browser automation)

**Process:**
1. Get multi-version sections from MongoDB
2. For each section:
   - Fetch selector page
   - Extract version metadata
   - Use Playwright to click each version
   - Extract content per version
3. Save with version data

**Performance:**
- Per section: ~8s (2 versions)
- FAM estimated: ~5-10 sections × 8s = ~1-2 min

## 🗄️ Database Schema - 100% Compatible

### Collections Aligned with Old Pipeline

| Collection | Purpose | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `section_contents` | Main section data | ✅ Aligned |
| `code_architectures` | Code metadata | ✅ Aligned |
| `jobs` | Job tracking (new) | ✅ Added |
| `processing_status` | Legacy (accessible) | ✅ Available |
| `multi_version_sections` | Legacy (not used) | Phase 3 |

### section_contents Schema

**All Old Pipeline Fields Present:**
```javascript
{
  // Core
  code, section, url,

  // Content
  content, raw_content,
  has_content, content_cleaned,
  content_length, raw_content_length,

  // Legislative history
  legislative_history, raw_legislative_history,
  has_legislative_history,

  // Multi-version
  is_multi_version, version_number,
  is_current, operative_date, description,

  // Hierarchy
  division, part, chapter, article,

  // Metadata
  metadata, updated_at
}
```

**Compatibility:** ✅ legal-codes-api will work without changes
