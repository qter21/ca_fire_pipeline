## 🔧 Enhancements Completed

### Enhancement #1: Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff ✅

**Added to:** `pipeline/services/firecrawl_service.py`

**Implementation:**
```python
def scrape_url(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            # Attempt scrape
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            if is_retriable_error(e) and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # 2s, 4s, 8s
                time.sleep(wait_time)
                continue
```

**Features:**
- Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
- Detects retriable errors (SSL, connection, timeout)
- Up to 3 attempts per URL
- Logs retry attempts

**Result:** ✅ FAM §9003 now works (was transient SSL error)

### Enhancement #2: Complete Legislative History Extraction ✅

**File:** `pipeline/services/playwright_version_fetcher_simple.py:205-217`
**Priority:** High
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Now extracts complete history

**Problem:** Initially only extracted first `<i>` tag (42-65 chars, missing bill numbers & dates)

**Fix:** Collect ALL `<i>` tags and return LAST (most specific) one

**Implementation:**
```python
# Collect ALL history candidates from <i> tags
history_candidates = []
for i_tag in soup.find_all('i'):
    if 'Stats.' in i_tag.text and has_legislative_action(i_tag.text):
        cleaned = clean_and_normalize(i_tag.text)
        history_candidates.append(cleaned)

# Return LAST (most specific/complete) legislative history
legislative_history = history_candidates[-1] if history_candidates else None
```

**Result:**
- FAM §3044 Version 1: **200 chars** (was 42) ✅
- FAM §3044 Version 2: **149 chars** (was 65) ✅
- **EXACT MATCH with YAML test data!**
- Includes: Bill numbers (SB 899), effective dates, operative dates, cross-references

### Enhancement #3: Version Model Fixed ✅

**File:** `pipeline/models/section.py:11-12`

**Change:**
```python
# Before:
operative_date: str = Field(...)  # Required
content: str = Field(...)  # Required

# After:
operative_date: Optional[str] = Field(None)  # Optional
content: Optional[str] = Field(None)  # Optional
```

**Result:** ✅ Stage 3 can now save versions without operative dates
