## 🐛 Known Data Quirks

### 1. CCP Missing 6 Multi-Version Sections

**Sections:** §35, §205, §231.7, §2016.090, §527.85, §527.9

**Issue:**
- Originally extracted with 12 versions
- Lost when Stage 1 re-ran to add tree structure
- bulk_upsert overwrote with None values

**Impact:** 6/3,353 sections (0.18%)

**Workaround:** Re-run Stage 2 & 3 for CCP (~20 min)

**Fix Applied:** bulk_upsert now skips None values ✅

---

### 2. EVID legislative_history Field

**Issue:**
- legislative_history: None
- raw_legislative_history: Has data
- Field mismatch caused by Stage 1 re-run

**Impact:** Visual only - data exists in raw_legislative_history

**Workaround:** Query raw_legislative_history instead

**Fix Applied:** bulk_upsert now skips None values ✅

---

   - All codes have hierarchical tree structure
   - All have url_manifest
   - All have statistics

3. ✅ **Multi-Version Working**
   - FAM: 7 sections, 14 versions ✅
   - PEN: 39 sections, 78 versions ✅
   - Total: 46 sections, 92 versions ✅
   - Complete legislative history with bill numbers & dates

4. ✅ **Concurrent Scraping**
   - Validated 9x faster (CCP, EVID, PEN)
   - 207 sections/minute throughput
   - Handles rate limits gracefully

5. ✅ **Schema Compatibility**
   - Collections: section_contents, code_architectures ✅
   - All required fields present
   - legal-codes-api compatible

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. bulk_upsert Must Skip None ✅

**Lesson:** Don't overwrite existing data with None
**Fix:** Filter out None values before $set
**Impact:** Can safely re-run Stage 1 now

### 2. Concurrent Scraping Scales ✅

**Tested:** 3 codes with 25 workers
**Result:** 9x faster consistently
**Conclusion:** Production ready

### 3. Tree Structure Essential ✅

**Lesson:** Old pipeline uses tree + url_manifest
**Impact:** Required for full compatibility
**Implementation:** Added to Stage 1

### 4. Test Before Changing ✅

**Lesson:** Re-running Stage 1 caused data loss
**Impact:** Lost CCP multi-version data
**Prevention:** Now fixed with None filtering
