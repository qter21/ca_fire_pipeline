### Stage 3: Multi-Version Extraction ⚠️

```
Status: ⚠️ FAILED (validation error)
Duration: 84.18 seconds (1.40 minutes)
Multi-version sections: 7
Extracted: 0
Failed: 7
```

**Error:** Pydantic validation error
```
operative_date
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=None, input_type=NoneType]
```

**Root Cause:**
- Version model requires `operative_date` to be a string
- Playwright extraction returned None for operative_date
- Need to make operative_date Optional or handle None

**Failed Sections:** (All due to same validation error)
1. FAM §3044
2. FAM §6389
3. FAM §17400
4. FAM §17404.1
5. FAM §17430
6. FAM §17432
7. FAM §17504

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Easy fix (make operative_date Optional)

**Fix Required:** 1 line change in `pipeline/models/section.py`:
```python
# Change from:
operative_date: str = Field(...)

# To:
operative_date: Optional[str] = Field(None, ...)
```
