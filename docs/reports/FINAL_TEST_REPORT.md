## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue: FAM 400 Legislative History

**Problem:**
The previous extraction logic was picking up Chapter-level legislative history instead of section-specific history:
- ❌ Got: "Chapter 1 enacted by Stats. 1992, Ch. 162, Sec. 10."
- ✅ Expected: "Amended by Stats. 2019, Ch. 115, Sec. 8. (AB 1817) Effective January 1, 2020."

**Solution:**
Created `pipeline/services/content_parser.py` with improved extraction logic:

```python
class ContentParser:
    @staticmethod
    def extract_section_content(markdown: str, section: str) -> Tuple[str, Optional[str]]:
        """Extract section content and legislative history"""
        # Matches from section header to next section
        # Correctly identifies section-specific legislative history
```

**Result:**
- ✅ FAM 400 content: 2,590 characters extracted
- ✅ All subsections present: (a), (b), (c), (d)
- ✅ Correct legislative history: "Amended by Stats. 2019..."
- ✅ Test now passes

### Coverage Analysis

**Excellent Coverage:**
- ✅ `config.py`: 100%
- ✅ `firecrawl_service.py`: 82%

**New Module (Partial Coverage):**
- ⚠️ `content_parser.py`: 56% (newly added, used in 1 test)

**Coverage Improvement Opportunities:**
- Add unit tests for `ContentParser` methods
- Test edge cases in extraction logic
- Cover error handling paths

**Note:** Even with 72% coverage, we have **100% test pass rate** because:

## ⏱️ Performance Analysis

### Test Execution Times

**Slowest 10 Tests:**
1. `test_single_version_sections`: 10.69s (validates 8 sections)
2. `test_batch_extract_mixed_codes`: 7.04s (batch API calls)
3. `test_legislative_history_extraction`: 6.29s (validates 8 sections)
4. `test_batch_extract_fam_sections`: 2.52s (batch API calls)
5. `test_multi_version_detection`: 1.50s (2 API calls)
6. `test_extract_fam_400_complex_section`: 0.92s ⚡ **FAST!**
7. `test_detect_multi_version_ccp_35`: 0.89s
8. `test_extract_fam_architecture`: 0.88s
9. `test_extract_single_version_sections[PEN_692]`: 0.82s
10. `test_extract_single_version_sections[FAM_1]`: 0.78s

**Analysis:**
- Most time spent on API calls (expected)
- YAML validation tests are slow due to multiple sections
- Individual section tests are fast (<1s each)
- Unit tests are extremely fast (<0.1s total)

### Performance Summary

## 🆕 New Components

### ContentParser Module

**File:** `pipeline/services/content_parser.py`
**Purpose:** Extract section content and legislative history from Firecrawl markdown
**Coverage:** 56%

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Main extraction
extract_section_content(markdown, section) -> (content, history)

# Utilities
extract_all_legislative_histories(markdown) -> list
normalize_text(text) -> str
is_multi_version(url, markdown) -> bool
extract_version_links(links) -> list
extract_section_number_from_url(url) -> str
```

**Why It's Better:**
- ✅ Correctly identifies section-specific vs chapter-level history
- ✅ Handles complex multi-line content
- ✅ Extracts complete subsections
- ✅ Fallback patterns for edge cases
- ✅ Reusable across all tests

---

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before ContentParser

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Test Pass Rate | 96.9% (31/32) |
| Failed Tests | 1 (FAM 400) |
| Issue | Wrong legislative history |
| Code Coverage | 86% (less code) |

### After ContentParser

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Test Pass Rate | **100%** (32/32) ✅ |
| Failed Tests | **0** 🎉 |
| Issue | **FIXED** |
