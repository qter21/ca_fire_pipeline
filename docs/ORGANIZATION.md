## 🎯 Organization Principles

### Technical Documentation (`docs/technical/`)

**Purpose:** Long-term reference material

**Contents:**
- Architecture and design documents
- Setup and configuration guides
- Technical specifications
- Upgrade and migration guides

**Audience:** Developers, architects

**Update Frequency:** As needed when architecture changes

---

### Reports & Summaries (`docs/reports/`)

**Purpose:** Status updates and results

**Contents:**
- Test results and coverage reports
- Phase completion summaries
- POC results and analysis
- Achievement summaries
- Status updates

**Audience:** Project managers, stakeholders, developers

**Update Frequency:** After each phase/milestone

## 🔍 How to Find Documents

### "I want to understand the project"
1. Start with root `README.md`
2. Read `docs/technical/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
3. Check latest report in `docs/reports/`

### "I want to set up the project"
1. `README.md` - Quick start
2. `docs/technical/SETUP.md` - Detailed setup

### "I want to see test results"
1. `docs/reports/PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` - Latest results
2. `docs/reports/COMPLETE_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Full validation
3. `docs/reports/TDD_TEST_RESULTS.md` - TDD details

### "I want to understand POC findings"
1. `docs/reports/POC_SUMMARY.md` - Quick overview
2. `docs/reports/POC_RESULTS_FINAL.md` - Detailed analysis
3. `docs/reports/MULTI_VERSION_STATUS.md` - Multi-version approach

## ✅ Benefits of This Organization

1. **Clean Root Directory**
   - Only `README.md` in root
   - Easy to find entry point

2. **Clear Separation**
   - Technical docs vs status reports
   - Easy to find what you need

3. **Scalability**
   - Can add more categories as needed
   - Won't clutter root directory

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear where new docs go
   - Easy to update and archive

5. **Navigation**
   - Index files (README.md) in each folder
   - Links between related documents

## 📝 Guidelines for Future Documents

### Adding Technical Documentation

Place in `docs/technical/` if:
- Architecture or design document
- Setup or configuration guide
- API specification
- Technical reference material
- Migration or upgrade guide

### Adding Reports/Summaries

Place in `docs/reports/` if:
- Test results or coverage report
- Phase completion summary
- Status update or progress report
- Achievement summary
- POC or analysis results
- Performance benchmarks

### Root Directory

**Only keep in root:**
- `README.md` - Main project entry point
- No other markdown files

---

## 🔄 Document Lifecycle

### Active Documents
- Keep in current location
- Update as needed
- Link from README files

### Archived Documents
- Move to `docs/archive/` (create if needed)
- Update links
- Keep for historical reference

### Deprecated Documents
- Remove if no longer relevant
- Update any links
- Consider creating a "replaced by" note

- [ ] Add to folder's README.md index
- [ ] Update main docs/README.md if important
- [ ] Link from related documents
- [ ] Add date and status at top
