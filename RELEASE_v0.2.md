## Breaking Changes

### Docker Image Change

**v0.1 (if existed)**: Debian-based, lightweight (~200MB)
**v0.2**: Ubuntu-based, full-featured (~700MB)

**Migration**: Pull new image and restart container - no code changes needed

### No API Changes

All API endpoints remain backward compatible.

## Performance Metrics

### Production Validation Results

| Metric | Old Pipeline | v0.2 Pipeline | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **EVID (506 sections)** | ~30 min | 3.04 min | **10x faster** |
| **FAM (1,626 sections)** | ~90 min | ~10 min | **9x faster** |
| **Multi-version support** | Manual | Automatic | âœ… Automated |
| **Success rate** | ~95% | **100%** | Better |
| **Deployment** | Local only | **Production** | âœ… Cloud |

### Throughput

- **Average**: 3.5-4.5 sections/second
- **Peak**: 6.4 sections/second (FAM batch 2)
- **Concurrent workers**: 15 (configurable)
- **Batch size**: 50 sections

## Bug Fixes

### Issue #1: Playwright Not Working in Debian

**Problem**: Multi-version sections failed with "Chromium executable not found"

**Root Cause**: Debian-based Python image has incomplete Playwright dependencies

**Solution**: Switched to Ubuntu 22.04 base image with full Playwright support

**Impact**: Multi-version extraction now works 100% in production

### Issue #2: Scripts Not in Docker Image

**Problem**: `scripts/` directory excluded from Docker image

**Root Cause**: `.dockerignore` contained `scripts/`

**Solution**: Removed `scripts/` from `.dockerignore`

**Impact**: Can now run complete pipeline scripts in container

---

## Deployment Guide

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start pipeline container (on GCloud)
cd ~/ca-codes-platform
docker compose --profile pipeline up -d ca-fire-pipeline

# 2. Process a code
docker exec ca-fire-pipeline python scripts/process_code_complete.py EVID

# 3. Monitor progress
docker logs ca-fire-pipeline -f

# 4. Verify results
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/codes
```

### Production Architecture

```
Google Cloud (us-west2-a)
â”œâ”€â”€ codecond-ca (website) - https://www.codecond.com
â”œâ”€â”€ legal-codes-api (API) - Port 8000
â”œâ”€â”€ ca-fire-pipeline (NEW) - Port 8001
â”œâ”€â”€ ca-codes-mongodb - Port 27017
â””â”€â”€ ca-codes-redis - Port 6379
```

---

## Known Issues

### API Statistics Display

**Issue**: `/api/v2/codes` shows FAM at 99.57% instead of 100%

**Actual Status**: All 1,626 sections are complete and accessible

**Root Cause**: API counting logic doesn't properly count multi-version sections

**Impact**: Display only - no functional impact

**Workaround**: Direct MongoDB query shows 1,626 documents

**Fix**: Update `legal-codes-api` statistics endpoint (future release)

---

## Upgrade Instructions

### From v0.1 (or earlier) to v0.2

```bash
# 1. Build new image with Ubuntu + Playwright
cd /path/to/ca_fire_pipeline
docker build -t ca-fire-pipeline:v0.2 .

# 2. Or pull from Artifact Registry
docker pull us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/project-anshari/codecond/ca-fire-pipeline:latest

# 3. Restart container
docker compose --profile pipeline up -d ca-fire-pipeline

# 4. Verify Playwright working
docker exec ca-fire-pipeline playwright --version
```

## What's Next

### Immediate (Phase 3)

1. **Process remaining 26 codes** using validated pipeline
   - Expected time: 4-6 hours for all codes
   - Expected success: 99-100% based on validation

2. **Complete California legal codes dataset**
   - All 30 codes processed
   - ~50,000 total sections
   - Full multi-version support

### Future Enhancements

1. **Parallel code processing** - Process multiple codes simultaneously
2. **Auto-update scheduler** - Daily/weekly data refresh
3. **Web dashboard** - Real-time progress monitoring
4. **Notification system** - Email/Slack on completion
5. **API endpoint** - Trigger processing via API calls
