## 📋 Review Completed

I have completed a comprehensive review of your project's TDD (Test-Driven Development) practices and created a detailed improvement plan with practical implementation resources.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Current State
- **Test Coverage:** 27% (well below industry standard of 80-90%)
- **Test Count:** 50 tests (36 unit, 14 integration)
- **Critical Gaps:** 
  - 0% coverage on API routers
  - 0% coverage on main application
  - 23% coverage on database operations
  - 15-26% coverage on services

### What's Working Well ✅
- 100% coverage on data models
- Good test organization (unit/integration separation)
- pytest properly configured
- Real test data available
